    "### Question 4 (20 points) Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a classical search method. Given a sorted list of n elements, write a function to search a given element x in the list. Specifically, searching a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half. Repeatedly check until the value is found or the interval is empty.\n",

    "import bisect\n",
    "\n",
    "c = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7]\n",
    "bisect.bisect(c, 2) #output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement your own binary search function, with two arguments: a sorted list and a number to be checked, such that function returns the index of the number in the list, if the number is not in the list, print \"The number is not in the list!\"\n",

    "    Example input: input_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7], number = 3\n",
